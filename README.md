# Credit Score Dashboard (iScore)

A smart, stylish Python-based GUI application to **calculate and visualize credit scores (iScore)** using data distributed across multiple relational databases. Built with `customtkinter`, `matplotlib`, and MySQL, this system offers a polished user experience, color-coded analytics, and full CRUD support.

---

## Features

- **Modern Gauge Chart** (matplotlib): Live rendering of user iScore as a half-donut arc with color-coded performance bands.
- **Beautiful Flutter-inspired UI**: Light pink theme with rounded buttons and intuitive icons.
- Add / Delete users directly from the GUI with instant refresh.
- Export scores and ratings to CSV for external use.
- Private fields protected — national IDs are hidden from public views.
- Fully synced with a distributed database structure (users, payments, debt, history, mix).
- Live user list refresh after updates.
- GUI built with `customtkinter` for a mobile-like desktop experience.

## iScore Calculation Logic

Each user’s credit score is calculated based on weighted inputs from:

| Metric          | Weight  | Data Source (DB)    |
|-----------------|---------|---------------------|
| Payment History | 35%     | `payments_db`       |
| Credit Usage    | 30%     | `debt_db`           |
| Credit History  | 20%     | `history_db`        |
| Credit Mix      | 15%     | `mix_reference_db`  |
